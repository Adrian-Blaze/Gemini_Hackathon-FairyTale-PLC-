Making E-commerce inventory and stock management easier with AI

# Problem Statement:
Stock control in large retail chain businesses within the e-commerce sector can be cumbersome and time-consuming especially as the size of such business grows. Retrieving relevant information from stock inventory records and sales records, often stored in CSV documents, by old and mundane methods often presents a challenge. The need for a more efficient and user-friendly solution to query and interact with these records is evident. To address this issue, the fairytale PLC application leverages AI through LLMs and the LangChain library to simplify the old process of stocking control - querying stock records by allowing users to upload CSV documents, ask questions in a conversational user convenient format, and receive responses in a streamlined manner. The goal is to enhance the overall efficiency and ease of managing stock records in the e-commerce domain.


## Features

- File Upload: Users can upload a CSV document containing inventory records and sales records for querying.
- Question Input: Users can enter questions about the records in the CSV document.
- Response Generation: The application uses the LangChain library to generate responses based on the uploaded CSV document and the user's question.
- User-Friendly Interface: The application is built with Streamlit, providing a clean and intuitive interface for a seamless user experience.
